# Seoul-Bike-Rent-Prediction
This project aims to predict bike rental demand in Seoul using a Linear Regression model. The project encompasses various stages of the machine learning pipeline, including data visualization, feature engineering, and model tuning with Lasso and Ridge regularization. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of bike rental data. Creation of relevant features to enhance the predictive power of the model.Handling categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and addressing missing data. Implementation of a Linear Regression model to capture the linear relationship between features and bike rental demand. Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared. Utilization of Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2) regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and enhance model generalization.
Fine-tuning hyperparameters for optimal model performance.
